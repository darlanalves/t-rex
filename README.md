## Unstoppable T-Rex

My goal here is to implement a library that uses express as a router, mongoose as a DB layer and some filters as input/output controllers.

Once it's done, you should write a Mongoose Schema to define a resource and write additional business logic (if any) to validate inputs. That should be enough to run a RESTful webservice.

## Install

```
npm install --save express t-rex

```

## Sample app

I'll maintain a [sample app](https://github.com/darlanalves/trex-seed) too
